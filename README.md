# Weather App

Yes, it’s another weather app. Groundbreaking, right? Who wouldn’t want to build a weather app in their journey through learning Flask?
It’s the ultimate rite of passage for aspiring developers. While it may be a cliché, this weather app is **my** cliché.

## Features (because you’re dying to know)
- A dark mode toggle for the sad and nocturnal.
- Celsius/Fahrenheit switch, because not everyone is stuck in the imperial system.
- A responsive layout, so you can be absolutely mindblown by this app, even though you have a more robust weather app on your phone.
- A 3-day forecast to help you decide whether to go outside or do nothing again.

## Installation (like every other project)
1. Clone this repository (because, of course, you want your own weather app):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakeherron/weather-app.git
